Alliance;Customer Touchpoints;ALX-CTP;Martin Geisler;Tribe;Digital Identities & Experience;ALX-CTP_T02;Ralf Helber;ALX-CTP_T02_Sq13;Florian Friedrich;Web3;"Web3 describes a secure internet experience, where individuals have greater control over their data and interactions. It involves moving away from centralized control and towards decentralization, which means power is spread across a network of users rather than being held by a few organizations. This shift brings several benefits, including increased privacy through pseudonymity, which allows users to interact without revealing their true identities. Encryption ensures that communication and data transmission occur securely, protecting users from unauthorized access. Web3 promotes trustless interactions, meaning that transactions and agreements can be carried out without relying on one central authority.

 

The Agile Development Unit Web3 contributes know-how and code to the collaborative development with other Web3 oriented companies, cooperates in ramping up and (partially) operating the required infrastructure and develops product for RB units to utilize Web3 benefits in their processes and systems.

 

Our solutions consists of:
* infrastructure components and services in the field of Self Sovereign Identity e.g. identity wallets
* services to pseudonymize and confidential compute data e.g. ShieldByte
* contribution to public and private blockchain networks

 

DevOps concepts, including continuous deployment, testing and security architectures are key for our product development.Web3 serves as a catalyst for digitizing processes and creating standards. 
We develop products on blockchain and cloud using frameworks such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, Docker, Kubernetes or Terraform in public clouds such as MS Azure.
